<h1>ZigJS Tutorial</h1>
<h2>Step 1: Getting Started</h2>
<p>Make sure you have the following prerequisites: </p>
<ul>
    <li>ZigJS Browser Plugin</li>
    <li>Microsoft Kinect or Asus Wavi Xtion</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Hello World</h2>
We're going to make our first app, which will be useless except as a test to make sure all the right things are talking to each other in the background.  
This app is a blank page that will simply display an alert when the Zig plugin loads.
Create an html file with the following content:

<pre class='prettyprint'><code class='language-html'>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;User Radar&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script src='http://motionos.com/zigjs/beta/zig.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;

    function ZigPluginLoaded() {
        alert('Hello Motion World!');
    }

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;!-- ZigJS plugin --&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;pluginContainer&quot;&gt;
  &lt;object id=&quot;ZigPlugin&quot; type=&quot;application/x-zig&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;param name=&quot;onload&quot; value=&quot;ZigPluginLoaded&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>
The included script from motionos.com is zig.js, which provides all the bindings you'll need to interact with the Zig browser plugin.  
That script activates the plugin object, which calls the <code>ZigPluginLoaded</code> function upon finishing loading.  Note that you don't have to have an onload attribute for the plugin
in general.  It's a good way of testing the basic functionality of the plugin, and for doing something different on your site based on whether or not the user has the plugin installed.
</p>
<h2>Step 3: User Radar Sample App</h2>
<p>
Now let's go ahead and make something that's actually useful! 
This will be the user radar, which will have little dots that move around inside of a box to indicate where the users are in the room.  Ok, so maybe it's not the most useful thing,
but it's an important component for a number of applications and should be a good introduction to the zigfu object model, which is used throughout the entire ZDK.  
</p><p>
First things first, comment out the alert; it's obnoxious and doesn't deserve to be part of this new and improved sample.  Ok, now l    et's start with the box.
We'll code up the user radar using a div for the box, and have some JavaScript code that creates a div for each dot.  Add the following code inside the head of the HTML:
</p>
<pre class='prettyprint'><code class='language-html'>&lt;style&gt;
    div#radar 
    {
        width: 400px;
        height: 400px;
        border: 1px solid black;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>
and the following code to the body.  It doesn't matter whether it goes before or after the div that contains the plugin:
</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'><code class='language-html'>&lt;div id='radar'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>


<p>
This makes the box (the div called 'radar') 400 x 400 pixels (set arbitrarily) and gives it a border so you can see where it is.

We'll receive events from the <code>zig</code> object, and for the <code>onnewuser</code> callback, we'll instantiate an object with that class and stick it in the box.
Then each time there's new data from the Kinect, there will be an <code>onupdatedata</code> callback, and in that callback we'll move the user to the appropriate position on the screen.
But first things first, let's get set up with receiving callbacks from the <code>zig</code> object and make sure that the callbacks are being run.  
Edit the <code>ZigPluginLoaded</code> function to look like this:
</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'><code class='language-js'>function ZigPluginLoaded() {
    var plugin = document.getElementById(&quot;ZigPlugin&quot;);
    zig.init(plugin);
    var radardiv = document.getElementById('radar');

    // The radar object will respond to events from the 
    // zig object and move the dots around accordingly.
    // It is also responsible for creating and destroying 
    // the dots when users are added and removed.
    // Functions onnewuser(), onlostuser(), and ondataupdate() 
    // are called by the zig object when those things happen.
    var radar = {
        onnewuser: function (user) {
            console.log('running onnewuser in radar');
        },
        onlostuser: function (user) {
            console.log('running onlostuser in radar');
        },
        ondataupdate: function (zigdata) {

        }
    };
    // Add the radar object as a listener to the zig object, so that 
    // the zig object will call the radar object's callback functions.
    zig.addListener(radar);
}

</code></pre>
<p>At this point, the file in its entirety should look like this:
</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'><code class='language-html'>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;User Radar&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script src='ZigJS/new/zig.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;

    function ZigPluginLoaded() {
        var plugin = document.getElementById(&quot;ZigPlugin&quot;);
        zig.init(plugin);
        var radardiv = document.getElementById('radar');

        // The radar object will respond to events from the 
        // zig object and move the dots around accordingly.
        // It is also responsible for creating and destroying 
        // the dots when users are added and removed.
        // Functions onnewuser(), onlostuser(), and ondataupdate() 
        // are called by the zig object when those things happen.
        var radar = {
            onnewuser: function (user) {
                console.log('running onnewuser in radar');
            },
            onlostuser: function (user) {
                console.log('running onlostuser in radar');
            },
            ondataupdate: function (zigdata) {

            }
        };  
        // Add the radar object as a listener to the zig object, so that 
        // the zig object will call the radar object's callback functions.
        zig.addListener(radar);
    }

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
    div#radar 
    {
        width: 400px;
        height: 400px;
        border: 1px solid black;
        position: relative;
        overflow: hidden;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;div id='radar'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- ZigJS plugin --&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;pluginContainer&quot;&gt;
  &lt;object id=&quot;ZigPlugin&quot; type=&quot;application/x-zig&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;param name=&quot;onload&quot; value=&quot;ZigPluginLoaded&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
To check if this works, open the html file in a browser and open a JavaScript console.  
We'll use the log messages to see whether the radar object's callbacks are being called when they should be.  
In Google Chrome on Windows, you can open a JavaScript console by hitting F12.  Now, with the console open, 
go to a place where the sensor will be able to see you.  The sensor only has about a 45 horizontal field of view, so make sure you stay within that.
Also, the sensor is far-sighted and doesn't have reading glasses, so you'll have to stay at least three or four feet from the sensor for it to detect you.
When the sensor first detects a user, the console should look something like this:
</p>
<pre>Zig: inited
Zig: New user: 3
running onnewuser in radar
</pre>
<p>
The last line is the log message that you just put into the radar object's <code>onnewuser</code> function.  The first two lines are debug messages from the <code>zig</code> object.  
You can disable debug messages from the <code>zig</code> object by including <code>zig.verbose(false)</code> after <code>zig.init()</code>, although
it's generally a good idea to leave the messages in until you're ready to release your app.
</p>
<p>
If you do see the New User message from the <code>zig</code> object, but 
not the <code>onnewuser</code> message, then for some reason, <code>onnewuser</code> is not being called.  
Double-check that the spelling of the functions is correct, because if it's not, the code will simply fail silently.
If you don't see anything in the console, then reload the page and try again ... if you still don't see it, then for some reason the Zig plugin isn't running. 
See our <a href='#'>Troubleshooting</a> page for more help.
</p>
<p>
Now cover the red glowy part of the sensor with your hand for about ten seconds so it can't see you.  You should see the following messages in the console:
</p>

<pre>Zig: Lost user: 3
running onlostuser in radar
</pre>

<p>
Now that the callback structure has been set up, the next step is creating the dot that will go inside the box to represent a user.
We want to create a new dot each time a user is found, and destroy the dot when the user is lost.  
We also want the dots to move around correctly, but let's get them creating and destroying correctly first.
Since the user dots should all look the same, create a css class called <code>user</code> that we'll add to all the objects that we create in the JavaScript code.  
</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'><code class='language-css'>div.user 
{
    position: relative;
    width: 10px;
    height: 10px;
    background-color: blue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Now, let's add the code that creates and destroys the dots.  One of the cool things about the 
zigfu JavaScript API is that each <code>user</code> object supplied by the <code>zig</code> object persists
until the user is lost.  This means that we can add properties and methods to <code>user</code> objects dynamically.
In this case, an elegant way of associating a div with each user is
to add a reference to a user div as a property of the respective <code>user</code> object.
